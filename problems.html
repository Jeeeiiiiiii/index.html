        <h2>PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED</h2>
        <p> In today's situation, It is very hard especially because of this pandemic.
            A thought came to me and made me think that our households doesn't have any way to somehow protect us from the virus aside from our masks.
            From there I've decided to improve our doorbells since it is the first thing that our guests/visitors will use before coming in to our house.
            <br>
            <br>
            First problem that came into my mind was on competency. As my first time entering the business industry, I've imagined how hard it is to keep up a business 
           <br>
           <br>
           Though this problem can be solved with the right time, experiences and right mentors that will guide me to grow on how ot handle businesses. 
           <br>
           <br>
           Another problem was the technology. I believe with the rapid movement of our technology, my product might go to waste.
           <br>
           <br>
           Another problem is that, the difference between my product and the mall's scanner and sanitizer. This would be explained on the next page.
